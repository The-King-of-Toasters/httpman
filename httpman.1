.SH CUSTOMISATION
.P
httpman relies on a path for httpman_codes.yml to be precompiled.
By default this is at /etc/httpman_codes.yml, but it can be anywhere
the user chooses. For a custom location, one must patch httpman.go
and run make in the form:
.P
CFG_PREFIX=/my/path/here sudo make install
.P
An example patch file for httpman.go is provided in the git repo.
